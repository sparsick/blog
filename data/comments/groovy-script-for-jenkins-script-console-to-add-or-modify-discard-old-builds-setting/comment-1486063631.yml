comment: "Hi Sharat,\n\nI studied the source code of Jenkins to find out which parameter\
  \ I have to adjust. I recommend Intellij IDEA Community Edition or Netbeans for\
  \ Groovy scripting (IMHO they support Groovy better than Eclipse) and set up a Maven\
  \ project that has Jenkins Core and Jenkins Plugins (that you need) in its dependencies\
  \ declaration (Here is an <a href=\"https://github.com/sparsick/scripts-jenkins-console/blob/master/pom.xml\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">POM example</a>). \nI hope that helps.\n\n\
  Best regards,\n\nSandra"

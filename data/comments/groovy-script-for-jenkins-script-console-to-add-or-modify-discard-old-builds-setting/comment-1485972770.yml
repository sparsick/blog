comment: 'Hi Sandra,


  I am working on migrating and cleaning up of around 350 CI jobs. I am new to groovy
  scripting. Is there a way I can get a crash course on how to navigate jenkins jobs.


  For ex: After the migration I see that all the jobs have a default JDK in them instead
  of custom JDK version. I need to script out groovy in such a way that I select my
  custom JDK from the drop down of JDK list and set that for all the jobs.'

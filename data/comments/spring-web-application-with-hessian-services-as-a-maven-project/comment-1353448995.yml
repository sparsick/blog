comment: 'Hi Sandra,


  Thank you for the response. However, I am still having an issue.


  When I am running the HessianClient, I am getting this exception:

  Exception in thread "main" org.springframework.remoting.RemoteConnectFailureException:
  Cannot connect to Hessian remote service at [http://0.0.0.0:8080/hello-world/hessian/HelloWorldService];
  nested exception is com.caucho.hessian.client.HessianConnectionException: HessianProxy
  cannot connect to ''http://0.0.0.0:8080/hello-world/hessian/HelloWorldService


  Here are the steps I did:

  1. run "mvn clean package install"

  2. start up tomcat -&gt; go to http://0.0.0.0:8080/manager to deploy the hello-world-war-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war  in
  maven-spring-hessian/hello-world-war/target

  3. Run HessianClient class in IntelliJ IDE.


  Do I miss something?'

We collect two basic types of information from You from Your use of the Website: Personal Data and Non-Personal Data.

[Back to table of contents](#tableofcontents)

## 2 Personal Data

"**Personal Data**" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

As a general matter, You can browse the Website without submitting Your Personal Data to Us. However, there are a number of circumstances in which You may supply Us with Your Personal Data.

### 2.1 Data We Collect

We collect the following Personal Data from You:

*   Full Name;

[Back to table of contents](#tableofcontents)

## 4 Use of Personal Data

We do NOT sell or license Your Personal Data to any third party.

We may process any of Your Personal Data identified in this Privacy Policy where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure.

In addition to the specific purposes for which We may process Your Personal Data set out in this clause, We may also process any of Your Personal Data where such processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which We are subject, or in order to protect Your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.

## 5 Data Security

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to Us, both during transmission and once We receive it. We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in Our possession. This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls.

We use **HTTPS**

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an internet communication protocol that protects the integrity and confidentiality of data between your computer and blog.sandra-parsick.de. The use of HTTPS makes sure your communication with us is:

**Encrypted** — The data you exchange with us is secure from eavesdroppers. That means that when you are browsing blog.sandra-parsick.de, nobody can track your activities across multiple pages, or steal the data exchange between your computer and blog.sandra-parsick.de.

**Integral** — The use of HTTPS preserves the integrity of data. Your data cannot be modified or corrupted during transfer.

**Authenticated** — HTTPS protocol authenticates your communication with us. This ensures that you are always communicating with our servers.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information You transmit to Us or store on the Website, and You do so at Your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of Our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If You believe Your Personal Data has been compromised, please contact Us at mail@sandra-parsick.de.

If We learn of a security systems breach, then We attempt to notify You electronically so that You can take appropriate protective steps. We may post a notice through the Website if a security breach occurs.

## 6 Your Data Privacy Rights

If You are a citizen of the EU, We have summarized the rights that You have under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in this Section. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in Our summaries. Accordingly, You should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.

**Right to Access**. You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not We process Your Personal Data and, where We do, access to the Personal Data, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of Personal Data concerned and the recipients of the Personal Data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, We will supply to You a copy of Your Personal Data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.

**Right to Rectification.** You have the right to have any inaccurate Personal Data about You rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete Personal Data about You completed.

**Right to Erasure.** In some circumstances You have the right to the erasure of Your Personal Data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the Personal Data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; You withdraw consent to consent-based processing; You object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the Personal Data have been unlawfully processed.

However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

**Right to Restrict Processing**. In some circumstances You have the right to restrict the processing of Your Personal Data. Those circumstances are: You contest the accuracy of the Personal Data; processing is unlawful but You oppose erasure; We no longer need the Personal Data for the purposes of Our processing, but You require Personal Data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and You have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, We may continue to store Your Personal Data. However, We will only otherwise process it: with Your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.

**Right to Object to Processing**. You have the right to object to Our processing of Your Personal Data on grounds relating to Your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in Us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Us or by a third party. If You make such an objection, We will cease to process the Personal Data unless We can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override Your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

You have the right to object to Our processing of Your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If You make such an objection, We will cease to process Your Personal Data for this purpose.

You have the right to object to Our processing of Your Personal Data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to Your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.

**Right to Data Portability**. To the extent that the legal basis for Our processing of Your Personal Data is consent, or that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which You are party or in order to take steps at Your request prior to entering into a contract, and such processing is carried out by automated means, You have the right to receive Your Personal Data from Us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

**Right to Complain to a Supervisory Authority**. If You consider that Our processing of Your Personal Data infringes data protection laws, You have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of Your habitual residence, Your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.

**Right to Withdraw Consent**. To the extent that the legal basis for Our processing of Your Personal Data is consent, You have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.

You may exercise any of Your rights in relation to Your Personal Data through written notice to Us. See Our Contact Details at the end of this Policy.

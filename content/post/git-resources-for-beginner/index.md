In this post I'd like to share resources that help me learning and understanding Git.

Links
=====

* ["Getting Git Right" tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/)
* [Interactive Git Cheatsheet](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html)
* [git ready](http://gitready.com/) Collection of tips based on use cases.
* [Article "Git ist einfach – wenn man weiß, wie" (in German)](https://jaxenter.de/git-ist-einfach-wenn-man-weis-wie-1638) This article describes how the data model of Git works. Understanding the data model helps me a lot with the handling with Git.

Do you have some more resources that you can recommend? Let me know it and write a comment.

I like to use [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) for having a bash shell on a windows machine. In combination with [Console2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/) you have a powerful command-line tool for windows. I'd like to describe how to install Cygwin and Console2 under windows 7 (I think this instruction works on Windows XP, too) and how to embed Cygwin in Console2. I used for Cygwin version 1.7.17-1 32bit and for Console2 version 2.00b148-Beta_32bit.

### Cygwin Installation

1.  Download [setup.exe.](http://cygwin.com/setup.exe)
2.  Double click on setup.exe starts the installation.
3.  Follow the set up instruction. As installation location I use `c:\cygwin.`
4.  Go to `c:\cygwin` and run `Cygwin.bat` for setting up Cygwin user home etc.

### Console2 Installation

1.  Download [zip file.](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/files/console-devel/2.00/Console-2.00b148-Beta_32bit.zip/download)
2.  Unzip it into installation location.
3.  Start Console2 with a double click on `Console2.exe.`

### How to embed Cygwin in Console2

1.  Open Console2.
2.  Go to `Edit -> Settings.`
3.  Go toÂ  `Tab`
4.  In field `title` insert for example `bash`. It is the name of the first tab in Console2.
5.  In field `Shell` you have to insert `C:\cygwin\bin\bash.exe --login -i` (Don't forget `c:\cygwin` is your installation folder).
6.  In field `Startup dir` you can insert `C:\cygwin\home\user.name.` This folder is used at every Console2 start.
